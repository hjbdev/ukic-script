# ukic spectator script

requirements: nodejs/bun (i like bun)

1. name your obs scenes with the steamid64 corresponding to each player
2. make sure obs-websocket is installed on obs
3. put the gamestate_integration_ukic.cfg file in the cs2 cfg directory
4. install dependencies with either `bun install` or `npm install`
5. run `bun index.js` or `node index.js`
6. maybe it works?
